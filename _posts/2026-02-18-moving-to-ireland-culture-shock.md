Moving to Ireland has been exciting, confusing, and occasionally hilarious. From the moment I arrived, I realised that even though we speak the same language, we don’t always mean the same things.

## The Language Isn’t the Same

The first time someone told me they’d meet me “in half an hour,” I learned that this wasn’t a strict countdown — it was more of a guideline.

And don’t get me started on:
- The difference between a **jumper** and a sweater  
- What “grand” actually means  
- Why everyone says “sorry” when *you* bump into *them*

## Everyday Cultural Differences

Back in the US, everything feels faster and more direct.  
In Ireland, there’s more time for conversation — even small interactions feel more personal.

At the shop, at the bus stop, grabbing coffee — people talk.

## The Pub Is a Social Space, Not Just a Bar

One of the biggest surprises was how the pub functions as:

- a meeting place
- a living room
- a community hub

Not just somewhere to drink.

## Final Thoughts

The biggest culture shock so far isn’t the differences — it’s how quickly Ireland has started to feel like home.
